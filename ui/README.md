##Q & A
1. What is the use of this boiler plate as we already have applications developed with same technologies ?
	A. When there a new project or a quick prototype needs to be done, This will be the starting point. No need to clone other projects clean up the code and some time for beginners it will a pain to start with a huge code base.
	This boiler plate have been designed keeping every one in mind. Code is not complicated, very easy to understand and pick up. When we contract the UI, it would be a good starting point for the contracting companies too to get started.
